# Performance Optimizations

This document describes the performance optimizations implemented in Wireshark+ Web to meet the requirements for efficient packet streaming, memory management, and concurrent client handling.

## Overview

The performance optimizations address the following requirements:
- **Requirement 2.1**: Packet streaming with less than 2 second latency
- **Requirement 2.3**: Efficient WebSocket broadcasting and memory management
- **Requirement 7.5**: Performance monitoring and optimization

## Backend Optimizations

### 1. Packet Buffer Management

**File**: `backend/capture.py`

#### Memory-Aware Packet Dropping
- **Memory Monitoring**: Uses `psutil` to monitor process memory usage
- **Dynamic Buffer Management**: Drops packets when memory usage exceeds configured limits
- **Intelligent Queue Management**: Drops multiple old packets (up to 25% of queue) when queue is full
- **Statistics Tracking**: Tracks packets captured, dropped, memory drops, and queue drops

```python
# Configuration
PacketStreamer(max_queue_size=1000, max_memory_mb=100)

# Memory-aware packet processing
if memory_info.rss > self.max_memory_bytes:
    self._stats['memory_drops'] += 1
    return  # Drop packet
```

#### Performance Statistics
- Packets captured/dropped counters
- Memory usage monitoring
- Queue utilization tracking
- Error rate monitoring

### 2. WebSocket Broadcasting Optimization

**File**: `backend/main.py`

#### Efficient Connection Management
- **Connection Limits**: Configurable maximum concurrent connections (default: 50)
- **Connection Rejection**: Gracefully rejects connections when at capacity
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes disconnected clients automatically

#### Asynchronous Broadcasting
- **Queue-Based Broadcasting**: Messages queued for efficient batch processing
- **Concurrent Sending**: Uses `asyncio.gather()` for parallel message delivery
- **Background Worker**: Dedicated async task for message broadcasting
- **Error Isolation**: Individual client errors don't affect other clients

```python
# Efficient broadcasting implementation
async def _broadcast_worker(self):
    # Batch process messages from queue
    tasks = [self._send_to_client(conn, msg) for conn in connections]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

#### Broadcasting Statistics
- Messages sent/failed counters
- Connection utilization tracking
- Queue size monitoring
- Success rate calculation

### 3. Performance Monitoring Endpoints

#### `/performance/stats` Endpoint
Provides comprehensive performance metrics:

```json
{
  "capture": {
    "queue_utilization": 0.45,
    "memory_utilization": 0.32,
    "stats": {
      "packets_captured": 1250,
      "packets_dropped": 15,
      "memory_drops": 2,
      "queue_drops": 13
    }
  },
  "websocket": {
    "active_connections": 8,
    "connection_utilization": 0.16,
    "success_rate": 0.998,
    "messages_sent": 5420,
    "messages_failed": 12
  },
  "system": {
    "process_memory_mb": 45.2,
    "memory_percent": 2.1,
    "cpu_percent": 8.5
  }
}
```

## Frontend Optimizations

### 1. Optimized Packet Buffer Management

**File**: `frontend/src/App.jsx`

#### Intelligent Buffer Limits
- **Adaptive Dropping**: More aggressive dropping when approaching buffer limit
- **Threshold-Based Management**: Starts dropping at 90% capacity (450/500 packets)
- **Efficient Array Operations**: Uses array slicing for O(1) operations

```javascript
// Optimized packet buffer management
if (prev.length >= dropThreshold) {
  const keepCount = Math.floor(maxPackets * 0.7); // Keep 70%
  const newPackets = [data, ...prev.slice(0, keepCount)];
  return newPackets;
}
```

#### Memory-Efficient Updates
- Limits packet history to 500 items
- Efficient rate calculation with minimal memory overhead
- Sparkline data limited to 60 data points

## Performance Testing

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite

**File**: `backend/test_performance.py`

#### Latency Testing
- Measures WebSocket packet delivery latency
- Verifies <2 second requirement compliance
- Tracks 95th and 99th percentile latencies

#### Concurrent Client Testing
- Tests up to 50 concurrent WebSocket connections
- Measures connection establishment time
- Monitors message delivery success rates

#### Memory Usage Testing
- Monitors memory usage under load
- Verifies memory limits are respected
- Tests memory leak detection

### 2. Load Testing Tools

**File**: `backend/test_load_websocket.py`

#### WebSocket Load Testing
- Configurable number of concurrent clients
- Configurable test duration
- Detailed performance metrics and reporting

```bash
# Run load test with 20 clients for 60 seconds
python test_load_websocket.py --clients 20 --duration 60
```

#### Performance Monitoring

**File**: `backend/monitor_performance.py`

- Continuous performance monitoring
- Threshold-based alerting
- Historical data collection
- Performance trend analysis

```bash
# Start continuous monitoring
python monitor_performance.py

# Single performance check
python monitor_performance.py --once
```

### 3. Automated Test Runner

**File**: `backend/run_performance_tests.py`

Comprehensive test suite that runs:
- Pytest performance tests
- WebSocket load tests
- Memory stress tests
- Performance monitoring

## Makefile Integration

New performance testing targets:

```bash
make test-performance  # Run comprehensive performance tests
make test-load         # Run WebSocket load test
make monitor          # Start performance monitoring
make perf-check       # Quick performance check
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance Metrics
