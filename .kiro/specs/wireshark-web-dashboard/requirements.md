# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Wireshark+ Web is a rapid development prototype that provides a web-based network packet analysis dashboard. The system captures network packets on a local machine, streams them live to a browser interface, and leverages AI to explain selected packets or network sessions. This tool is designed for network administrators, security analysts, and developers who need real-time network monitoring with intelligent analysis capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to capture network packets in real-time on my local machine, so that I can monitor network traffic as it happens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL begin capturing packets using elevated privileges (sudo or NET_ADMIN capability)
2. WHEN packets are captured THEN the system SHALL normalize them to JSON format with timestamp, source, destination, protocol, length, and port information
3. WHEN capturing packets THEN the system SHALL handle both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols
4. WHEN capturing TCP/UDP packets THEN the system SHALL extract source and destination port numbers
5. IF packet capture fails due to insufficient privileges THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about required permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to see live packet data streamed to my browser, so that I can monitor network activity in real-time without command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packets are captured THEN the system SHALL stream them via WebSocket to connected browsers with less than 2 second latency
2. WHEN multiple clients connect THEN the system SHALL broadcast packets to all connected WebSocket clients
3. WHEN the packet buffer reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL maintain only the most recent 500 packets in the frontend display
4. WHEN a WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically remove the client from the broadcast list
5. IF the WebSocket connection fails THEN the frontend SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a network analyst, I want to select individual packets and get AI-powered explanations, so that I can quickly understand suspicious or complex network behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a packet in the table THEN the system SHALL display detailed packet information in a side panel
2. WHEN a user clicks "Explain Packet" THEN the system SHALL send the packet summary to an AI service for analysis
3. WHEN AI analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL return a concise, actionable explanation of the packet and potential security issues
4. IF no OpenAI API key is configured THEN the system SHALL provide mock explanations for development purposes
5. WHEN AI analysis fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to filter captured packets by interface and BPF expressions, so that I can focus on specific network traffic of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL provide an API endpoint to list available network interfaces
2. WHEN a user selects a different interface THEN the system SHALL restart packet capture on the new interface
3. WHEN a user enters a BPF filter expression THEN the system SHALL apply the filter to limit captured packets
4. WHEN capture settings change THEN the system SHALL notify connected clients of the new configuration
5. IF an invalid BPF filter is provided THEN the system SHALL return an error message without crashing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to detect traffic anomalies automatically, so that I can be alerted to potential security incidents or network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packets are captured THEN the system SHALL maintain rolling statistics of packet counts per second
2. WHEN packet rates exceed normal patterns THEN the system SHALL calculate z-scores based on historical data
3. WHEN z-score exceeds threshold (default 3.0) THEN the system SHALL generate an alert message
4. WHEN anomaly alerts are generated THEN they SHALL be sent to connected clients via WebSocket
5. WHEN users click on alerts THEN the frontend SHALL filter the packet view to show the relevant time window

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to run with minimal setup, so that I can quickly demo the functionality without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL provide automated scripts for dependency installation
2. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL support both sudo execution and capability-based permissions on Linux
3. WHEN no OpenAI API key is provided THEN the system SHALL default to mock AI responses for development
4. WHEN starting the demo THEN the system SHALL automatically start both backend and frontend services
5. IF the system is running on macOS THEN it SHALL provide guidance for packet capture permissions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to see basic traffic statistics and visual indicators, so that I can quickly assess network load and patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packets are being captured THEN the system SHALL display current packet rate in the interface
2. WHEN viewing the packet list THEN the system SHALL show a simple sparkline visualization of traffic over time
3. WHEN traffic patterns change THEN the visual indicators SHALL update in real-time
4. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN they SHALL be visually highlighted in the interface
5. WHEN no packets are being captured THEN the system SHALL indicate the idle state clearly

Requirements
Requirement 8 – Enhanced User Interface & UX

User Story: As a network analyst, I want a richer, Wireshark-like interface, so that I can analyze traffic efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:

WHEN viewing packets THEN the system SHALL support column customization (show/hide source, destination, protocol, ports, length).

WHEN analyzing traffic THEN the system SHALL provide a hierarchical packet dissection panel (layered view: Ethernet → IP → TCP/UDP → Payload).

WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL allow text search across packet fields.

WHEN filtering THEN the frontend SHALL support advanced filters (protocol, IP, port, keyword).

WHEN hovering over fields THEN the system SHALL show contextual tooltips (e.g., what is TCP SYN, what is ARP, etc.).

Requirement 9 – Advanced Protocol Support

User Story: As a security engineer, I want more protocol decoding, so that I can detect issues in specific traffic types.

Acceptance Criteria:

WHEN decoding packets THEN the system SHALL parse and display details for DNS, HTTP, HTTPS (TLS handshake metadata only), ARP, and ICMP.

WHEN packets contain application-layer data (HTTP headers, DNS queries) THEN the system SHALL display readable summaries.

IF protocol parsing fails THEN the system SHALL display raw payload safely without crashing.

Protocol parsers SHALL be modular so new protocols can be added easily.

Requirement 10 – Security & Access Controls

User Story: As an admin, I want security features, so that only trusted users can run captures and view data.

Acceptance Criteria:

WHEN starting backend services THEN the system SHALL require an authentication token for WebSocket and REST access.

WHEN a client connects with no token or invalid token THEN the system SHALL reject the connection.

WHEN capturing packets THEN the system SHALL ensure users cannot inject arbitrary BPF filters that bypass privilege restrictions (sandbox filter parsing).
